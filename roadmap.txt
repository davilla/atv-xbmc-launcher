ToDos:

IR:
- need to detect platform to switch cookies and IR-controller name
- cookies need adoption (in AppleRemote.m)

Features:
-restart app that was running if it crashed:
 - probably only 3 times
 - use exit status of NSTask
 - implement shutdown menu restart request of xbmc with that
=> if XBMC crashes, it goes directly (and in a reasonable time) back to XBMC

-finish xbmclauncher CMake project
 - need to figure a way to build bundle (worst case by hand)
=> enables a build all and copy to ATV testing cycle

-add universalmode support to xbmchelper startup from multifinder
 - need to grab info from distributed notification in AppKeeper

-create plist for MultiFinder to read settings from
  - e.g. which app to start by default.

-add setting of timeout to univermode
