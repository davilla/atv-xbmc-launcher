ToDos:

Safety first:
- make sure that Frontrow gets launched if something goes wrong
  - add level of indirection around launchApplication that tries to launch the specified app, if it goes wrong, launch finder
  - MultiFinder should try three times to launch an App, then default back to Finder.app. 
  - use exit status of NSTask
  - Once defaulted back to Finder.app, then keep launching Finder.app even if it crashes. 
  - Finder.app has it's own tracking and if it crashes enough, it will kick into a recovery boot. 
  - add a way to disable the 3x crash for debugging the launched app
  - implement shutdown menu restart request of xbmc with that
 
- check that xbmchelper was started properly. if not, go into safe-mode (see safety first)

- add licence to files

- add setting to enable / disable multifinder in XBMCLauncher
- create dmg cmake target for MultiFinder
- create download of MultiFinder in xbmc-info-testing

-create plist for MultiFinder to read settings from
  - default app (including IR Mode)
  - IR timeout
  - verbose setting?
  - relaunchCount
  - debugging value for disabling finder restart after app crashes

- add setting of timeout to universalmode

- add convenience target to cmake that sets build environment up
  - maybe create a script in trunk/scripts/setupBuildEnvironment.sh for all the work
  - create a target in CMake to run that script with configured parameters (e.g. APPLETV_IP)
  - create external dir in trunk/
  - scp frameworks from ATV to trunk/external
  - download BRHeaders from http://alanquatermain.net/brdevkit/
  - copy Quartz stuff to trunk/external and patch it
  - match CMakeLists.txt  

-finish xbmclauncher CMake project
 - need to figure a way to build bundle (worst case by hand)
=> enables a build all and copy to ATV testing cycle
