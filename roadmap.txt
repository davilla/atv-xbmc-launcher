- fix LED

- add licence to files

- add setting to enable / disable multifinder in XBMCLauncher

- create download of MultiFinder in xbmc-info-testing

-add to MultiFinder's preferences:
  - IR timeout
  - verbose setting?

- add setting of timeout to universalmode

- add convenience target to cmake that sets build environment up
  - maybe create a script in trunk/scripts/setupBuildEnvironment.sh for all the work
  - create a target in CMake to run that script with configured parameters (e.g. APPLETV_IP)
  - create external dir in trunk/
  - scp frameworks from ATV to trunk/external
  - download BRHeaders from http://alanquatermain.net/brdevkit/
  - copy Quartz stuff to trunk/external and patch it
  - match CMakeLists.txt  

-finish xbmclauncher CMake project
 - need to figure a way to build bundle (worst case by hand)
