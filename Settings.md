There are few (currently 2 options) in the Settings menu:

### Universal Mode ###
default: off

If enabled, XBCMLauncher interprets special sequences of keypresses as one button and sends it to Boxee/XBMC. This allows to make full use of universal remotes. See UniversalMode for details.

### ATV Autoupdate ###
default: none. It's read from /etc/hosts

  * Enabling this setting adds a line to /etc/hosts (127.0.0.1 mesu.apple.com) which disables autoupdates of the ATV.
  * Disabling removes that line
